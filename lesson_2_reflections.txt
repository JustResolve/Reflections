What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the initial meta data files which defines the directory as containing a Git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a subset of files in the working directory and not yet apart of the repository.  The value of having a staging area is that you can control what gets committed to the repository instead of being forced to include every file in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A branch could be helpful if I am going to make a radical change to the software that will likely take a long time to complete but want to be able to debug a working version at the same time before the big change is done.
