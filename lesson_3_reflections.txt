When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I see several advantages of working on a remote repository as opposed to a keeping all work local.  Firstly, if something bad should happen to your local hard drive, all work might be lost as opposed to have a remote backup of all of your work in a remote repository.  Secondly, a remote repository could be useful if you are working on the same project from multiple computers.  Lastly, if you are working with a team, a remote repository would be an easy way to share and contribute work to the project.
